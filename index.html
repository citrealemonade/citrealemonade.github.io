   <h1>Our Begining</h1><br>
   <p>Modern day businesses usually start off in the garage with a bright idea; Citrea was a little different, it started off on the front lawn on a bright summer’s day. Selling lemonade was something I did for fun as a lonely 8 year old growing up in a quiet suburb with no other children around for several blocks. Hot summer days were the best for me. On those days the neighbourhood high school and college kids would finally step out of their houses and walk over for a refreshing drink and my wide eyes would fill with excitement at the hope of perhaps making a new friend. Eventually, one of these summers brought to me my best friend who I would one day start this company with.  Every summer following that day, we would set up the stand, and our regular customers, now our friends, would zoom on over. Business was booming, so much so that what was once a leisurely amusement transformed into a small business.  Citrea became a social hub for the neighbourhood, a place where you got to meet new people and reconnect with those from a past not too far.
    <br>
    <br>
  Wanting to hold on to the childhood innocence of the company’s humble beginnings, Citrea strives to recreate the feelings a hopeful child might have held most dear. Feelings that hark back to memories of the sun warmly shining down, the joyful enthusiasms of new discoveries and people, and the perhaps the tang of cool lemonade and sticky sugar. Our stand is located on a grassy patch of University Dr. With our wooden stand and fresh ingredients by our side, we're always ready to freshen your day!  </p>
